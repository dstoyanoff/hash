// seems to cache a reference to the patched globals). Real timers, uncontaminated, plus a wait past
// `COLOR_TRANSITION`'s 280ms, is what actually lets the final color be observed here.

  // a non-dimmable one (the fill bar covers it edge to edge), so two different label colors on two
  // identically-colored cards reads as a bug on sight. `text` has decent contrast against `accent`
  // in both themes (unlike white `accentText` against the dimmable tile's neutral `surface`, which
  // is only safe in dark mode), so every accented tile now uses the same, single label color
