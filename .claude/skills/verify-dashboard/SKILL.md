# Verify a dashboard

Run all of these; don't stop at typecheck passing.

## 1. Automated checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check   # or `pnpm format` to fix
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

`pnpm test` covers `packages/*` only — dashboards (`example/dashboards/*`) have no tests of
their own by design; typecheck plus the real-browser check below is how a dashboard gets verified.
If you scaffolded a new dashboard, confirm you actually did the
registration step from `create-dashboard` (`example/app/routes.ts`) — a dashboard that
typechecks fine but was never registered there simply won't be reachable, and nothing above will
tell you that.

## 2. Look at it in a real browser

The dev server is the only reliable way to catch a layout problem (e.g. a squeezed `ClimateTile`)
— there's no test coverage here to catch it instead.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/<id>` (and any other page/route it has).

Add `?grid` to the address to see the module grid over the page: a faint line at every spacing unit
(4px in the comfortable density), a stronger one at every tile pitch, and a box round each card with its
height in units, green when its top and height sit on the grid and red when they do not. The legend at
the bottom counts the red ones. The grid spans the whole page, its padding included (the first 3 units on each side, inside the dashed frame, which is where cards start). Nothing is remembered: it is on for that address only, so a link inside the app, or a reload without it, turns it off.

`pnpm dev` at the repo root is a thin `pnpm --filter @hashsome/example dev` passthrough — Vite's
dev server actually runs rooted at `example` and watches `dashboards/*` like any other source
file in that project, no restart needed between edits, just the usual HMR refresh. Two cases are
route-table changes, not plain content edits, and HMR doesn't always pick them up cleanly — do a
hard refresh (or restart `pnpm dev`) after either, and don't read a stale result as a real bug:
registering a brand-new dashboard (added its block to `app/routes.ts`), and
adding a new route to an _existing_ dashboard (also an edit to `app/routes.ts`).

Check, at the screen size it targets:

- Every section/tile you added is present and labelled correctly (no truncated labels, no two
  tiles with the same name).
- At least one interaction round-trips: click a light/scene/action tile, or drag a dimmable one,
  and confirm the state updates (it's reading from the mock or real backend through the actual
  WebSocket proxy, not a static render).
- If there's more than one page (a layout route with a `NavRail`/`NavDock`), every nav item goes to the right page and
  highlights as current.
- Nothing shows raw text like "unavailable" rendered incorrectly, unstyled, or a blank tile for a
  bad ref — bad refs should read "Not found", not error or vanish.
- Check the browser console for errors (not just the visual result) — a page can look fine while
  logging a real problem underneath (e.g. a WebSocket reconnect loop).

## 3. Production build (only if asked to ship / for a final check)

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open the same routes again. This exercises the SPA fallback and the real bundle, not just dev's
on-the-fly transform — worth doing once before calling a dashboard finished, cheap to skip during
iteration.
